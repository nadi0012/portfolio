Final Project – Web Portfolio

## Challenges


- Working with bootstrap was the first challenge that I face. Because all CSS and bootstraps, became confusing and finding errors became harder and harder.
- The hardest part is, making my banner with the triangular shape, I couldn’t make it responsive. But later, I find a way. With using a rectangle image and adding polygon to it. I found it on YouTube.[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6LAJsUkkyc&ab_channel=CodingArtist)
- The other challenging part was making a modal with a carousel inside. It became very crowded and hard for me, but after playing for a long time finally, it worked.
- My last challenge was making a line in the middle of the page, I did it, but unfortunately, I couldn't place circles on it.
- *There are some differences with mockups because that project was an imaginary person who has an office. But for my real portfolio, I have to erase addresses and phone numbers, so I rearrange some parts. And the parts of the project also changed with fewer items because I don’t have many projects yet.*
